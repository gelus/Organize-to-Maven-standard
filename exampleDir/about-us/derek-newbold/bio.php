		<p>Derek Newbold has more than a decade of software development experience.</p>
		<p>He drives the development of cutting-edge, revenue-producing technology solutions.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Derek has an eye for the big picture. He knows what action needs to be taken and takes it&mdash;perpetually delivering superior results to customers. </p>
	<p>Derek directs the production of industry-leading software development, as well as implementing new technologies and products. He leads by example, especially when it comes to work philosophy. Derek and his team work hard and play like their production depends on it, firmly believing that the right culture produces the right work.</p>
	<p>Derek joined Mindshare Technologies from Ingenix, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Healthcare Group, after three years of spearheading their development efforts. There, he delivered a new suite of Internet-based applications that generated over $15 million annually in new revenue. Derek was also fundamental to the development of technology solutions to replace existing manual processes for managing and delivering Ingenix publications that generated more than $50 million in annual revenue. Derek also worked at BlueStep, Inc. for two years where he was instrumental in the design and implementation of a large-scale, web-based collaboration system.</p>
	<p>Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s Smart and Get things Done shaped Derek&rsquo;s approach to business. He strives to read, research, and study new technology, but knows it isn&rsquo;t enough just to know and understand it. He rolls up his sleeves everyday, sometimes literally, and implements what he has learned. This extends to his team as he aspires each day for his &ldquo;students&rdquo; to become masters in their profession.</p>
	<p>Derek earned a B.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah and is Scrum Master Certified.</p>
