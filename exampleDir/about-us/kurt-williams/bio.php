	<p>As CPO of a company built on new technology, Kurt has a few thoughts on innovation: &ldquo;Innovation doesn't happen by running with the first idea that comes to you. You have to be willing to wrestle ideas longer than other people will.  You have to be willing to take one step past where you were comfortable. That next step always stretches you, but it's where the good ideas lie.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Kurt also remembers the words from his favorite fortune cookie: &ldquo;Every truly great accomplishment is at first impossible.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Kurt holds a bachelor's degree from Weber State University, specializing in software engineering and economics.</p>
