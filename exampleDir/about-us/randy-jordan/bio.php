	<p>Randy and his team work with brands across all segments of the food service industry from QSR to Fine Dining, building long-term partnerships and friendships with people inside brands such as Arby&rsquo;s, Panera Bread, Panda Express, IHOP, and Kona Grill. </p>
	<p>He leads a team of professionals focused on building strong and strategic partnerships with successful restaurant brands to help them discover and implement operational changes that enhance their guest&rsquo;s dining experience and overall brand loyalty.</p>
	<p>Randy began his career in the computer industry. His first &ldquo;real job,&rdquo; as he puts it, was with Burroughs Corporation, a computer hardware company. In his four years there, he met his wife and also gained the knowledge and experience that allowed him to start his own software company specializing in customer service and order processing applications. After a successful 22-year run in the technology industry, Randy sold his company and joined Creative Consumer Concepts (C3), a branding agency specializing in kids and family marketing for restaurants. During Randy&rsquo;s ten years with C3, he gained his affection for the restaurant industry and the people in it. With a desire to get back into the world of technology without leaving the food service industry, Randy resigned as President of C3 to join Mindshare in 2010.</p>
	<p>Randy and his wife Sondra are both Kansas City born and raised and proud of their Midwest roots. They recently celebrated their 31st anniversary and have two children. Randy has always been a &ldquo;music guy&rdquo; who appreciates all types of music, but he admits his true passion is for classic rock n&rsquo; roll. He plays keyboards and sings in the band Ryze, as well as in the worship band at his church. He also embraces Kansas City&rsquo;s jazz roots by serving on the board of directors for the American Jazz Museum. </p>
	<p>Randy also enjoys moonlighting as a keynote/motivational speaker and adamantly claims to have &ldquo;never been on a stage without having a good time.&rdquo; When asked what the greatest wisdom he can pass on to someone is, he smiles and answers, &ldquo;Practice does NOT make perfect... it makes permanent.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Randy has a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in business management from Kansas State University.</p>
