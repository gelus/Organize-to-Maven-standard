		<p>Erich Dietz has more than 15 years of executive-level experience.</p>
		<p>He is responsible for leading and managing the sales and support efforts for Mindshare&rsquo;s Contact Center vertical. </p>
	</div>
	<p>He is an operations and service-oriented executive focused on improving businesses&rsquo; end-to-end customer experience. He has extensive experience in developing and implementing VoC and CEM strategies and solutions for Fortune 500 organizations.</p>
	<p>Erich joined Mindshare in 2003 and was responsible for direct sales and support functions for clients across all major verticals. Today, he keenly focuses on driving business results and improved customer experiences. In addition to his direct client work, he frequently presents at VoC industry conferences and events and works with the analyst community on thought leadership content.</p>
	<p>Prior to Mindshare, Erich worked as a consultant with several consulting firms including Kurt Salmon Associates, Herbert W. Davis &amp; Company, and Sigman Kaiden.</p>
	<p>As a young man, one of Erich&rsquo;s friends introduced him to a core pillar of life: &ldquo;We reap what we sow.&rdquo; Erich has carried this philosophy with him every day since.</p>
	<p>Working alongside a construction crew as a gopher, Erich made the mistake of trying to take a shortcut on a task one day. He remembers a wise old carpenter catching his corner-cutting and uttering the words: &ldquo;No matter the job, big or small, do it right or not at all.&rdquo; This saying stuck with Erich and echoes in his head every time he takes on a new task.</p>
	<p>He holds a B.S. degree in industrial engineering from Rutgers School of Engineering.</p>
