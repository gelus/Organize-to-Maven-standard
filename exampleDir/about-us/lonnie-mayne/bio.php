	<p>Lonnie&rsquo;s earliest years in the workforce taught him that simple attentiveness and human kindness are as powerful in the business world as they are anywhere else. Throughout his career, Lonnie has helped translate these guiding principles into steady customer loyalty and consistent financial success for companies like McDonald&rsquo;s, Brooks Brothers, Firestone, Lord &amp; Taylor, Arby&rsquo;s, Hertz, Tony Roma&rsquo;s, and many other top brands.</p>
 
	<p>When Lonnie first joined Mindshare Technologies in 2006, he held the position of executive vice president of sales &amp; account management. In early 2012, he became Mindshare&rsquo;s chief experience officer (CXO), championing the <a href="http://www.mshare.net/our-approach/#approach">Sample Size of One&trade;</a> approach that sets Mindshare apart. Today, he acts as president of the company, working with every level of the organization to build lasting customer relationships based on mutual trust and proven value.</p>
 
	<p>Before joining Mindshare, Lonnie was vice president of special &amp; emerging markets for the Affinia Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan. There, he created high-performance sales teams and set the strategic direction for three operating divisions: heavy duty, retail, and the Affinia Motorsports/NASCAR program.</p>
 
	<p>His career at Affinia followed a successful tenure at No.1 International, where he began as VP of sales and finished as president of the factory engineering group and a member of the board of directors. There, his teams partnered with the most respected customers in the industry, helping them to increase sales and profitability. Lonnie joined No. 1 International from Timken Bearing Co. in Canton, Ohio, where he was national sales manager.</p>
 
	<p>In 2012, Lonnie created the <a href="http://www.redshoesexperience.com/">Red Shoes Experience</a>, a customer-experience movement that focuses on the simple and powerful nature of empathetic human service delivered on the front lines of business.</p>

	<p>Lonnie attended the University of Utah and later completed Ohio State University&rsquo;s executive education leadership program. He also received the distinguished automotive AAP degree from Northwood University in Midland, Michigan.</p>
