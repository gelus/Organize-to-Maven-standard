	<p>John&rsquo;s love of measurement, natural creativity, and skepticism toward established rules has guided him as he&rsquo;s led the charge toward truly &ldquo;frictionless&rdquo; feedback centered upon text analytics and recommendation engines. He has designed and directed the implementation of feedback systems for many of Mindshare&rsquo;s largest Fortune 500 clients and created many of Mindshare&rsquo;s best-in-class analytics.</p>
	<p>John leads the development and deployment of emerging technologies at Mindshare, including Mindshare&rsquo;s text analytics, business intelligence solutions, executive-level analytics, and new product thought leadership. Fond of the saying &ldquo;In God We Trust; All Others Bring Data,&rdquo; he focuses on combining real-world pragmatism and business vision to achieve best results.</p>
	<p>John joined Mindshare in its early stages and has been instrumental in building the feedback best practices and product innovations that have fueled the company&rsquo;s exceptional growth. Prior to Mindshare, John was a business consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, leading teams of financial analysts in business evaluation and process optimization. </p>
	<p>John&rsquo;s mantra is &ldquo;Question Everything.&rdquo; He believes that if you ask the right questions, you&rsquo;ll get the right answers. &ldquo;Moneyball-like opportunities abound&mdash;just waiting for the right question and the guts to take a chance.&rdquo; </p>
	<p>Pablo Picasso once said: &ldquo;The chief enemy of creativity is &lsquo;good sense.&rsquo;&rdquo; True innovation happens only when you question good sense and color outside the lines.</p>
	<p>John graduated magna cum laude with a degree in accounting from Brigham Young University&rsquo;s Marriott School of Business.</p>
