	<div id="preview">
		<p>John Sperry has been solving constrained business problems through automated systems for the last 18 years.</p>
		<p>He founded Mindshare in 2002 and works directly with the board of directors to guide the company direction.</p>
	</div>
	<p>Since 1995, John has guided and directed the product and technology development for three companies. </p>
	<p>In 2010, John was named a member of the V100 as one of the top entrepreneurs to lead a new venture to success. That same year he was named Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst &amp; Young&ndash;Utah Region. In 2008, John saw Mindshare Technologies become a member of the Inc. 500 and has secured the company&rsquo;s membership to Inc. 5000 every year since.</p>
	<p>Although he has manifold responsibilities, John directs much of his attention to product direction and strategy. He is an example and embodiment of Mindshare&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mshare.net/our-approach/#approach">Sample Size of One&trade;</a> philosophy. He is serious about knowing every Mindshare employee on a personal level, and he wants to see every employee succeed, because he believes their success breeds company success.</p>
	<p>John was CTO for BlueStep, Inc. from 1999 to 2002, where he helped design and implement a collaborative web solution used daily by 30,000 people from the state of Utah to the University of Arizona.</p>
	<p>John worked with Sungard Data Systems as their senior vice president of technology from 1998 to 1999. There, he implemented large enterprise financial and CRM solutions for companies such as State Farm, Citibank, Bank of America, Prudential Securities, MetLife, New York Life, and others. Before Sungard, John was the vice president of product development for Sterling Wentworth from 1995 to 1998. He implemented solutions with USAA, GMAC, Mutual of Omaha, Wachovia Bank and other financial institutions. John also spent a year working for the Garn Institute of Finance.</p>
	<p>For the last eight years, Mindshare Technologies has purchased Christmas trees from Primary Children&rsquo;s Medical Center&rsquo;s Festival of Trees to support their annual fundraiser. Mindshare then auctions the purchased trees to employees, donating the proceeds to Primary Children&rsquo;s a second time.</p>
	<p>The fundraiser is particularly close to John&rsquo;s heart because of the role the hospital played in performing open-heart surgery on his daughter Sariah and his son Samson. The surgery saved his son&rsquo;s life.</p>
	<p>John has his MBA and finance degrees from the University of Utah and Brigham Young University.</p>
